                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931,
                        Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a
                        leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
                        president of India from 2002 to 2007.</b>
                    Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,
                    which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first
                    intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in
                    1989.From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
                    principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His
                    prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and
                    established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
                    community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he
                    described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20
                    years.
